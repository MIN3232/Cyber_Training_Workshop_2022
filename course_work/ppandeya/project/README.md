# my project
Understand the strong emission in BBTA

# introduction
BBTA shows strong fluorescence at 568 nm and large Stoke's shift of 186 nm in buffer solution. It is found to have high photostability and low cytotoxicity.

# methods
Nonadiabatic dynamics with Libra/CP2k

Following steps 1 to 4 helps to perform successful nonadiabatic calculations.
